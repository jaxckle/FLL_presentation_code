# FLL_presentation_code
Arduino Introduction for FLL Students 🤖
Project Description

This project introduces FIRST LEGO League (FLL) students to the basics of Arduino programming and electronics. The goal is to help students understand how code interacts with hardware and how these ideas connect to robotics and engineering challenges used in FLL.

This project is beginner-friendly and assumes no prior experience with Arduino.

What Students Will Learn

What an Arduino is and how it works

How to upload code to an Arduino board

The purpose of setup() and loop()

How digital inputs and outputs work

How sensors and components interact with code

Basic debugging and problem-solving skills

Required Materials

Arduino Uno (or compatible board)

USB cable

Breadboard

Jumper wires

Electronic components used in the circuit (see code comments)

Software Requirements

Arduino IDE
https://www.arduino.cc/en/software

How to Use This Project

Install the Arduino IDE

Connect the Arduino to your computer using a USB cable

Open the .ino file in the Arduino IDE

Select the board and port:

Tools → Board → Arduino Uno

Tools → Port → Select the correct port

Click Upload to run the program on the Arduino

How This Relates to FLL

This project helps students develop:

Programming logic

Engineering thinking

Hardware-software connections

Team discussion and explanation skills

These skills directly support success in the FLL Robot Game, Innovation Project, and Core Values.

Student Challenges

Change values in the code and predict the result

Add another component (LED, sensor, or button)

Explain how the code works to a teammate

Connect the behavior of the Arduino to a real FLL robot task
